My Personal Portfolio

## 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
This is the start of my personal portfolio. It includes a picture of me and a quick "about me" of where I'm currently living, what I do and why I chose to begin the bootcamp. I used images as placeholders for where I will later put links of projects that I create througout the bootcamp. My contact info along with a link to my GitHub page are included in the contact section.

## Thank you
Aldo
